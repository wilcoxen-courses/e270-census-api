# Educational Attainment in New York Counties

Please provide brief answers to the questions below. They can be pretty terse: the idea is really just to have you spend a little time thinking about the results.

## Question 1
From the data you printed, what county has the largest population share with less than a high school education? How does that compare to the county with the next highest share?

TBD

## Question 2
From the diagonal panels of the figure, how do the quintiles compare in terms of the fraction of the population with less than a high school education? Specifically: are they roughly the same or do some quintiles differ noticably from the others?

TBD

## Question 3
In the diagonal panels for `"hs"` and `"ba+"`, the top two quintiles differ visibly from the others. Briefly, what does that indicate?

TBD

## Question 4
Two of the pairwise scatter plot panels (for a single pairwise comparison: one above and one below the diagonal) show very pronounced correlation between the two variables. What are the variables and what does the graph indicate?

TBD

## Question 5
Turning back to the printed output, what counties have values of `ratio` over 2? What are those values? Where are those counties or what is significant about them?

TBD

## Question 6
What county has the lowest value of `ratio`? What is that value? How many people with a high school education or less live in the county for each person who has a college or graduate degree? (That is, the inverse of `ratio`.)

TBD

## Question 7
How many counties have values of `ratio` that are below 0.5? You can count them by hand or you could compute `(ratio<0.5).sum()`, which will generate a vector with 1's where `ratio` is below 0.5 and 0's everywhere else and then sum it up.

TBD
