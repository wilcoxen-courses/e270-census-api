# Educational Attainment in New York Counties

1. What county has the largest population share with less than a high
school education? How does that compare to the county with the next 
highest share?

TBD

2. What counties have values of `ratio` over 2? What are those 
values? Where are those counties or what is significant about them?

TBD

3. What county has the lowest value of `ratio`? What is that value?
How many people are there with a high school education or less for each 
person who has a college or graduate degree? (That is, the inverse 
of the ratio.)

TBD

4. How many counties have values of `ratio` that are below 0.5? You 
can count them by hand or you could compute `(ratio<0.5).sum()`, which 
will generate a vector with 1's where `ratio` is below 0.5 and 0's 
everywhere else, and then sums it up.

TBD
